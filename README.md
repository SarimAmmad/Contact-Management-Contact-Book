# Contact-Management-Contact-Book
A basic C++ program which illustrates the functioning of contact book. It performs the basic working like addition of contacts viewing all contacts and deleting contacts. used vectors and classes to store contacts
This is the simple program which work as the contact book it gives user multiple options to do operations like

1.	Add new contact.
2.	View contacts.
3.	Delete Contact
I used vector and classes to implement this, the class of contact holds the data and then I used vectors to store multiple objects of contact class so I can save multiple data in multiple objects of class, this program uses switch to get user choice and according to it performed different functions. The deletion is done by searching the name in the vector and erasing it using erase() function.
